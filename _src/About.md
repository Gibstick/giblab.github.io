# About page

I'm a student and a developer. I'm currently in my second year 2B term at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo ON, working towards a Bachelor of Computer Science. I enjoy banging on keys, whether they're WASD keys or black and white keys.

Computer games got me hooked on computers, which then led to scripting, programming, and an ongoing university education.

[I think I can also call myself a musician](https://soundcloud.com/gibstuck). I produced many recordings of performances, sometimes live, as a part of AV crew in high school.

[Naturally, I'm a gamer too (Steam)](http://steamcommunity.com/id/gibstick).

Hope you enjoy the site.
