    Title: CS 246 Post-mortem

This post is motivated by both a desire to share a few of the key things I learned in CS 246, and a reluctance to study for exams. You can think of this as a "survival guide" for CS 246 even though it's not the type of course that really needs one (as opposed to CS 245 for example, which is a bad course). I say this because at the time of writing, the course has a 53% easiness rating on [uwflow](https://uwflow.com/course/cs246), and the midterm average for Spring 2015 was 61. I hope this post will help you succeed.
