    Title: How to fix Mumble overlay in TF2 (Windows)

Run TF2 with as an administrator. In the properties dialog for hl2.exe (usually under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2` these days), navigate to the compatibility tab and tick the option under the compatibility tab.

This isn't the ideal solution but it's the only workaround that's worked for me. You don't need to hack around your graphics settings, such as -dxlevel or -nod3dex in TF2's command line options. Of course you should evaluate the risks of doing this and consider whether it's worth the risk to have a Mumble overlay.

What I find weird is how TF2 needs more permissions, not Mumble. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can dig around and find out why.
