I found a really interesting problem in my STAT 230 course notes. Problem 2.8 on page 14 involves a cheeky and/or evil professor who decides to play a game with two of his students to determine their respective grades in STAT 230. The game is essentially to guess the professor's number, and to have a better guess than the other person. I found the problem fairly interesting, and although I lacked the theoretical knowledge to be able to solve it and prove that I had found an optimal solution, I knew I could code up a simulation and have fun doing it. [Here is what I came up with](http://cwang.me/Stats).
