# Projects

## [cs136-autosubmit](https://github.com/Gibstick/cs136-autosubmit)

Python script for automatically submitting assignments to Marmoset, the central submission server. Had to submit several patches for the [Marmoset library](https://github.com/hkpeprah/marmoset) I was using, and as of now there's still [a bug](https://github.com/hkpeprah/marmoset/pull/23) with zip files being opened in text mode, which messes them up quite a bit. Wrote this and the next project because I didn't want to be dead in the water when Seashell went down.

## [cs136-bunny](https://github.com/Gibstick/cs136-bunny)

Packaged python program for I/O testing, compatible with CS 136's testing format. Outputs a more useful diff, unlike the tool they use.

## [DiscoSheep](https://github.com/Gibstick/DiscoSheep)

A from-scratch remake of the popular bukkit plugin DiscoSheep. It spawns dancing sheep, and I guess the disco part of it is that they change colour. Somehow it still works with Spigot.

## [latex-fontawesome](https://github.com/Gibstick/latex-fontawesome)

A fork of an [outdated original](https://github.com/furl/latex-fontawesome), which itself was an update of another older version. It provides FontAwesome icons in XeLaTeX.

### Odd scripts

Not that impressive, but they could be useful.

[CS 136 Mark Calculation Script](https://gist.github.com/Gibstick/7bb97dbedc8ca2a0c67c) calculates your mark in CS 136 before going into the exam. It probably breaks when you don't have the required marks (need midterm mark).

[Desire2Perfect](https://gist.github.com/Gibstick/6a2d6e753c38f4335e2c) makes Learn display all grades as 100%.
