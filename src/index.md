# Charlie Wang

I’m a student and a developer. I’m currently in my third year 3A term at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo ON, working towards a Bachelor of Computer Science. I enjoy banging on keys, whether they’re WASD keys or black and white keys.

Computer games got me hooked on computers, which then led to scripting, programming, and an ongoing university education.
