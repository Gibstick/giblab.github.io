   <title>Why Seashell seems to suck</title>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the night before the assignemnt is due, and you have errors out the wazoo. You debug furiously with a frown. All of a sudden, Seashell is down! &lt;strong&gt;FIX IT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, it&amp;rsquo;s not really Seashell&amp;rsquo;s fault. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seashell is a great project, built by some very talented developers at Waterloo and various other contributors. Your ISA might have worked on Seashell this term. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/cs136/seashell"&gt;Seashell&amp;rsquo;s github&lt;/a&gt;. It also has other contributors, like CS 136 students. All this to say, the core Seashell developers know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. Pretty sure the lead developer is getting paid for it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Seashell goes down it&amp;rsquo;s almost always because of the CSCF&amp;rsquo;s (Computer Science Computing Facility) servers going down or becoming generally unresponsive. Seashell uses three backend servers, and these backend servers are shared with pretty much everyone in the CS faculty. So you have other people doing work on these servers, running their programs, etc. Marmoset also runs its tests on these servers. Other courses also run their tests on these servers. Sometimes, people (perhaps unintentionally) hog a lot of system resouces. This kills the server. What follows is an explanation of some of the issues we&amp;rsquo;ve had this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent incident involved Seashell not running/testing any files. Saving probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t working too. The culprit was CS 341 running tests that ate up 100% memory and 100% CPU. At one point they brought down two servers this way. 100% memory means 128GB of memory; at some other point they brought down the beefier server with 256GB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This other time, someone ran a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb"&gt;fork bomb&lt;/a&gt; on one of the servers, rendering that backend server unresponsive. A fork bomb is basically a program that calls itself over and over, multiplying and using up system resources and process IDs. There are ways to prevent this, but the servers aren&amp;rsquo;t configured to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, when Marmoset stops testing, the web servers get slow. When this happens Seashell takes dozens of seconds to load, but once you&amp;rsquo;re in it&amp;rsquo;s generally OK. Marmoset issues are not new&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/3021ga/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_cs_136_has_been_a/cpos958"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/3021ga/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_cs_136_has_been_a/cpol9ca"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;, and they&amp;rsquo;re caused by the enormous load from ~800 students submitting the night before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t blame the people who work hard on Seashell. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot better than what came before: RunC in VirtualBox. VirtualBox is mediocre at best, and it&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely horrible experience on low-end computers. Before that, they just told people to code with a terminal&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/3021ga/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_cs_136_has_been_a/cpp5qse"&gt;(3)&lt;/a&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s that hacker thing with all the text and commands), which probably scared away a lot of people. Seashell is nice and it abstracts away all these messy details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a later post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover my CS 136 workflow. I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually use Seashell that, since I wanted to learn and get used to certain things that would be required for later courses and programming industry in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description></item>

   <title>How to download files from Seashell when Seashell is down</title>

&lt;p&gt;We all love Seashell, because the only course-sanctioned alternative would be to use RunC inside VirtualBox. But sometimes, the CSCF servers buckle under our load, and then Seashell becomes slow or inaccessible at times. Or maybe, since you worked hard on all your assignments, you just want to keep a copy of your them. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get your files from Seashell, even if Seashell is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id="windows-users"&gt;Windows Users&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Navigate to This PC / My Computer.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;Map Network Drive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Pick any drive you want, maybe W: for Waterloo, and for Folder, enter &lt;code&gt;\\smb-files.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca\USERID&lt;/code&gt; where USERID is your Quest/WatIAM/whatever username.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;\CS-TEACHING\USERID&lt;/code&gt; as the username. If you&amp;rsquo;ve used Seashell before, enter your standard Waterloo password here. If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, &lt;a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/password/"&gt;reset your password&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Now enter your newly-added network drive. Optional: Show hidden files/folders by going to View &amp;gt; tick &amp;ldquo;Hidden items&amp;rdquo; from the menubar.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to show hidden files/folders, append &lt;code&gt;.seashell&lt;/code&gt; to the path in the location bar and press enter. Otherwise, enter the &lt;code&gt;.seashell&lt;/code&gt;folder. It will appear greyed out because it is a hidden folder.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;All your Seashell projects will be in the &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt; folder. You can copy these files as you would for any other file in Windows. Don&amp;rsquo;t move/delete anything unless you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, but copying is safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/img/pub/windows_network_drive_.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/pub/windows_network_drive_.png" alt="Screenshot of This PC / My Computer" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src="/img/pub/windows_logon.png" alt="" /&gt; &lt;img src="/img/pub/windows_seashell_folder.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="mac-users"&gt;Mac Users&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: these instructions work for the Mac Labs too, but you can skip step 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Open Finder.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;From the menu, Go -&amp;gt; Connect to Server&amp;hellip; (command-K)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;smb://smb-files.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/USERID&lt;/code&gt; as the Server Address, where USERID is your Quest/WatIAM/whatever username.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Optional: Click the "+" icon to add it to favourites.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Click Connect.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Enter your username/password. If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, &lt;a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/password/"&gt;reset your password&lt;/a&gt;. Note: after this step, it might be necessary to manually go into your user folder. Just scroll through and find it; the folder name is your username.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Navigate to the &lt;code&gt;.seashell&lt;/code&gt; hidden folder: Go &amp;gt; Go to Folder (Shift-Command-G), type &lt;code&gt;.seashell&lt;/code&gt;. Go.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;All your Seashell projects will be in the &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt; folder. You can copy these files as you would for any other file. Don&amp;rsquo;t move/delete anything unless you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, but copying is safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/pub/Mac_smb_add.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/pub/Mac_finder_goto_seashell.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id="linux-users"&gt;Linux Users&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seashell files are all stored under &lt;code&gt;~/.seashell/projects/&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca&lt;/code&gt;. If you know how to mount SMB shares (I don&amp;rsquo;t), the address is &lt;code&gt;smb://smb-files.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/USERID&lt;/code&gt; where USERID is your username. Or just mount the root and navigate to your directory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
